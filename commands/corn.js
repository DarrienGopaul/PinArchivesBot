I am employed as a student for New York University, and I don't leave my dorm. I don't smoke, but I drink a lot. I'm in bed by 9am, and I make sure to get four hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of Erin's cum and doing no stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until midnight. Just like a crackhead, I wake up with much fatigue and stress at night. I was told there were serious issues during my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wants to kill themself. I take care not to trouble myself with enemies, because as a programmer I am my own enemy. This is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me depression. Although, if I were to fight against a typical programmer they would drop out before me.");
